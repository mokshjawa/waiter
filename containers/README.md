This directory contains code and configurations for building the docker containers
that are used to run and test Waiter in our development environments.

As part of the setup for both our minimesos (Marathon) and minikube (Kubernetes)
continuous integration pipelines, we run the ./bin/build-docker-images.sh
script found in this directory.
